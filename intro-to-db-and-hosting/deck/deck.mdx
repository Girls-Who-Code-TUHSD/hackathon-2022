BE SURE TO COVER THE DIFFERENCES,
YOU REMOVED THE DEDICATED SLIDE FOR THAT.

- Relational - Tables with fixed columns. 
- Document Store - Stores JSON documents, key/value pairs.

Document stores are often easy to get started with, are flexible,
and can be quite fast for queries and filtering.

SQL / Relational DBs shine with well defined data structures,
consistent data, and multi table queries (relationships).
