# What is a database?

<Notes>

2m

- An organized collection of structured information, or data.
- Most common types of databases organize data into tables with
  rows of data, similar to a spreadsheet.
- Improvements over spreadsheets to allow for network access,
  larger volumes of data, and multiple user access scenarios.

# Common Types of Databases

### Relational

<Steps>

- MySQL
- Postgres
- MariaDB

</Steps>

### Document Store / NoSQL

<Steps>

- Mongo
- DynamoDB
- CouchDB

</Steps>


<Notes>

5/6m

BE SURE TO COVER THE DIFFERENCES,
YOU REMOVED THE DEDICATED SLIDE FOR THAT.

- Relational - Tables with fixed columns. 
- Document Store - Stores JSON documents, key/value pairs.

Document stores are often easy to get started with, are flexible,
and can be quite fast for queries and filtering.

SQL / Relational DBs shine with well defined data structures,
consistent data, and multi table queries (relationships).

# Other Types of Databases

<Notes>

2m

Just quickly cover that there are many other types, Time-Series, Financial, Graph, In Memory.

Links for further research in Readme.

# SQLite and Replit

[REPL.it](https://replit.com/@retrocede/TUHSD-Hackathon-2022-Intro-to-DB)

<Notes>

For these examples we will be using REPL.it and SQLite.

- Since replit is a tool you already have had some exposure to, and they are a sponsor for the hackathon.
- and b/c SQL/Relational databases are going to be generally the most common type you run into.

Link to a replit, share screen.

Aim for ~20m here. Things I would like to at least briefly touch on:

- What is a Table?
- What is a Schema?
- What is an Entry / Row ?
- Primary and Foreign Keys
- One to One and One to Many relationships
- Queries
- Joining
- Migrations
- Seeding

</Notes>

# Database Q&A

Additional Learning topics to add to readme

- ACID
- first, second, and third normal forms
- query optimization
- stored procedures
- indexing
