## Installation

## Next Steps
### Front End
 - instead of the Pokemon links (href) taking the user to a page with JSON, when the user clicks a link, have it fetch the JSON at that URL and display it on the same page.
 - when the user clicks on one of the Pokemon, use an anchor link to scroll that Pokemon to the top
 - paginate the list of Pokemon a) on the front end, or b) via query parameters in the API call
